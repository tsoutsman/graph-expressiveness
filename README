2024S2 GNN ASC
==============

Requirements:
```
cargo
geng
gshow
```
`cargo` can be installed here:
https://www.rust-lang.org/

`geng` and `gshow` are part of the `nauty` package and can be downloaded here:
https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/
`nauty` can also be installed using `brew` (at your own risk).

Prior to running the code, run `./gen.sh`. That will generate the following
files in the project directory:
```
4.0K	graphs1.txt
4.0K	graphs2.txt
4.0K	graphs3.txt
4.0K	graphs4.txt
4.0K	graphs5.txt
4.0K	graphs6.txt
8.0K	graphs7.txt
 88K	graphs8.txt
2.1M	graphs9.txt
114M	graphs10.txt

4.0K	cgraphs1.txt
4.0K	cgraphs2.txt
4.0K	cgraphs3.txt
4.0K	cgraphs4.txt
4.0K	cgraphs5.txt
4.0K	cgraphs6.txt
8.0K	cgraphs7.txt
 76K	cgraphs8.txt
2.0M	cgraphs9.txt
112M	cgraphs10.txt
```

Then the code can be run using `cargo` i.e. `cargo run --release`.

Whether to compute for connected graphs or all graphs, and the maximum number of
vertices to compute for can be changed at the top of the `main` function in
`main.rs`.
